# OsuMixer
There is no Mikuia for Mixer so I thought of creating a simple Bot, which sends Chat requests from Mixer to you In-Game.

## Setup
### Mixer
1. Set up a Bot account from https://mixer.com/lab/oauth
1. Don't use a Secret Key
1. Use http://www.google.com as Website or something
1. Use localhost as hosts
1. Get the Client ID and Put it in Config/MixerClientID...

### Osu
1. Get an API Key from https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api
1. Paste it into your Config/OsuApiKey...

### Osu IRC
1. Get an IRC ID/PW from https://osu.ppy.sh/p/irc
1. Paste it into your Config/irc...
1. (Opt) Get a Bot Account from peppy. You don't need to since you can message yourself. I don't care if you get chatbanned though.

## To be added
1. PP Calcualtor
