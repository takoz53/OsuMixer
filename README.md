# OsuMixer
There is no Mikuia for Mixer so I thought of creating a simple Bot, which sends Chat requests from Mixer to you In-Game.

## Setup
All you need is a clientID (for now) from Mixer and an ApiKey from osu!. You also need a Bot Account (You don't. You should get one though!) for osu! to have someone send you the Beatmaps. You set those up and you're good to go.

### Why it works without a Bot Account
You can send yourself a message through IRC. You can't message yourself through client though. Recieving maps is possible without a Bot account. I don't take responsibilities if you get Chatbanned 5 mins etc. though. I do not know which consequences could happen.
