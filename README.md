# OsuMixer
There is no Mikuia for Mixer so I thought of creating a simple Bot, which sends Chat requests from Mixer to you In-Game.

## Setup
All you need is a clientID (for now) from Mixer and an ApiKey from osu!. You also need a Bot Account for osu! to have someone send you the Beatmaps. You set those up and you're good to go.
